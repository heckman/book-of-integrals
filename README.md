# Book of Integrals

Solutions to some common integrals---a study aid for MATH 110B-Calculus II at CCSF.

The integrals are numbered corresponding to the reference pages of Stewart's Calculus Early transcendentals, 8th edition.

## Output

The intention is to print this double-sided, cut in half, and put in a small binder.

## LaTeX

This is written in LaTeX, which I'm fairly new to.

## WARNING:

These solutions might very well be wrong!

## Cheers!
