# Book of Integrals

Solutions to some common integrals&mdash;a study aid for MATH 110B: Calculus II at CCSF.

The integrals are numbered corresponding to the reference pages of our textbook: Stewart's Calculus Early transcendentals, 8th edition.

There is also a table of the integrals that appear on page 403 of our textbook, which we are permitted to use without explanation.

## Build

Files in the build directory may not be current.

## Index

After adding or removing any integrals, regenerate the index: run `./list-integrals > integral-list.tex`.

TODO: automate this.

## LaTeX

This is written in LaTeX, which I'm fairly new to, so it's a bit of a mess.

## WARNING

These solutions might very well be wrong!

## Cheers!
