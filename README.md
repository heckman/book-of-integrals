# Book of Integrals

Solutions to some common integralsâ€”a study aid for MATH 110B: Calculus II at CCSF.

The integrals are numbered corresponding to the reference pages of Stewart's Calculus Early transcendentals, 8th edition.

There is a table of the first 11 integrals, which we are permitted to use without explanation.

So far solutions are included to the integrals numbered

- 12 to 21
- 63 to 66
- 71 and 72
- 82 and 83
- 92
- 96 and 97
- 100 and 102

## Output

## Index

To generate the index of integrands, run `./list-integrals > integral-list.tex`.

## LaTeX

This is written in LaTeX, which I'm fairly new to, so it's a bit of a mess.

## WARNING:

These solutions might very well be wrong!

## Cheers!
